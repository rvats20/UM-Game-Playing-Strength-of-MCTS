## Introduction

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for decision processes, most notably employed in game playing. This repository contains the code and resources used to participate in the Kaggle competition focused on assessing the performance of MCTS in various game scenarios.

## Competition Details

- **Host**: Kaggle
- **Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of MCTS algorithms in game playing.
- **Dataset**: Provided by Kaggle, includes various game scenarios and outcomes.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Performance of the MCTS algorithm in terms of win rate and computational efficiency.
